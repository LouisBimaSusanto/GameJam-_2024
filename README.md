🗂️ Folder Structure
This project uses the following folder structure. Each minigame has its own folder, and you must not modify others' work to reduce the chances of conflicts:

📂 Assets
 ┣ 📂 Minigame1
 ┃ ┣ 📂 UI
 ┃ ┣ 📂 Characters
 ┃ ┣ 📂 Animations
 ┃ ┗ 📂 Scripts
 ┣ 📂 Minigame2
 ┃ ┣ 📂 UI
 ┃ ┣ 📂 Characters
 ┃ ┣ 📂 Animations
 ┃ ┗ 📂 Scripts
UI: Contains all UI assets and elements used in the minigame.
Characters: Contains character assets such as sprites or models.
Animations: Contains animations for the minigame, whether for characters or UI.
Scripts: Contains the scripts (C#) used for the minigame logic.
⚠️ Important Rules:

Each person must create their own scene and must not use someone else's scene.
Scene naming convention: Use the format Minigames{number}. Example: Minigames1, Minigames2, and so on.
Do not modify other team members' work without permission.
⏳ Workflow Progress & Pull Request
Do not submit a pull request unless your work is fully completed. Ensure all features or minigames are finished and tested before submitting a pull request.
If you want to show progress, use a video or screen recording to demonstrate your progress. Do not merge unfinished work into the dev branch.
